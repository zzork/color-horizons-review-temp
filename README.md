### About

Color Horizons is a microtonal-capable scale generator and synthesizer.

It is designed specifically to enable the user to instantly calculate how the notes of all modes of any scale that it can create compare against 12 tone equal temperament, the harmonic series, and more.

The user can then immediately play these scales in the browser using the QWERTY keyboard or their device's touchscreen and then can export those scales as .scl files that can be used to retune other synthesizers.

Color Horizons is built with React and the Web Audio API.
