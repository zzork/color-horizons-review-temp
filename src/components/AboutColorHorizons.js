            Color Horizons is a microtonal-capable scale generator and
            synthesizer.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is designed specifically to enable the user to instantly
            calculate how the notes of all modes of any scale that it can
            generate compare against 12 tone equal temperament, the harmonic
            series, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            The user can immediately play these scales in the browser using the
            QWERTY keyboard or their device's touchscreen and then can export
            those scales as .scl files that can be used to retune other
            synthesizers.

            I sincerely believe that microtonality is not just a musical niche
            for iconoclasts, but that in time it will someday become the next
            frontier of popular music.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is an incredible wealth of musical expression that is
            inaccessible utilizing only 12 Tone Equal Temperament (12TET).
            Technology has reached a point where any musical tuning system
            imaginable can be tested instantly. The problem now is not
            necessarily the construction of microtonal-capable instruments, but
            the lack of proliferation of this knowledge. Whatever the reasons
            may be, at the moment this field remains esoteric. Many newcomers
            find it difficult to even know where to begin.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal with this application is to become an active participant in
            spreading knowledge of these fruitful tonal possibilities to other
            musicians. Color Horizons is a tool for helping explore musical
            realms near and far from 12TET. What tonal colors are available off
            in the distance? Let's find out.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is my deep wish that this tool can help inspire and facilitate
            musical creation!

            scales outside of 12 tone equal temperament, I never would have
            found a persistent interest in microtonality. (Another great

            microtonal music while we were on tour in 2016. Prior to that, I was
            under the impression that all music outside of 12 tone equal
            temperament sounded inherently bad. How wrong I was!

          <p>
            For best user experience, use the latest Google Chrome. At minimum,
            to be able to generate audio, the browser must be this version or
            newer:
          </p>
          <p>
            Chrome 35 - Edge 12 - Firefox 25 - Opera 22 - Safari 14.1 - WebView{" "}
            Android 37 - Chrome Android 35 - Firefox for Android 25 - Opera
            Android 22 - Safari on iOS 14.5 - Samsung Internet 3.0
          </p>
          <p>
            On iPhone ensure the mute switch is disengaged, as it currently
            mutes Web Audio, and will therefore mute this app.
