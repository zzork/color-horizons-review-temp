      <p>
        Now that we have covered cents, we will cover a few more ratio topics
        that are more easily demonstrated with the assistance of that
        measurement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another unexpected behavior of fractions within the world of JI comes
        when you stack ratios on top of one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's build a chord using the note 3/2 above the root, and then the note
        that is 7/4 above that second note.
      </p>
      <p>
        In normal fraction math, one would find the common denominator, then add
        the numerators together. This yields 13/4, which becomes 13/8 after
        following the octave reducing procedure. This does not work in JI. Don't
        do that.

        21/8 octave reduces to 21/16. In its octave reduced notation, the chord
        that contains 3/2 and the note 7/4 above 3/2 will be built of the notes:
        1/1, 3/2, and 21/16.
