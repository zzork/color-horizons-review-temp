        This scale is very harmonious, since it is made up entirely of very
        simple ratios.

        One thing that we like to do in music is play in different <b>modes</b>{" "}
        of a given scale, meaning{" "}
        <i>
          to interpret one of the non-root intervals in the scale as the new
          root
        </i>
        . Then, if desired, we can{" "}
        <i>
          take the intervals that would be built from that note and build a new
          set of pitches from our base Hz value.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to do this, take the scale degree that you would like to start
        on and subtract it from every other interval in the scale. As in the
        Subtraction section above, do this by dividing the two intervals, which
        is the same as cross multiplication, meaning to multiply one ratio by
        the reciprocal of the other. Here's the process using 9/8 as the new
        starting note:

        This particular transformation results in what many consider to be a
        problem. This example was picked specifically because{" "}
        <i>
          its 5th interval, 40/27, is just the right distance from 3/2 (about 22
          cents off) that the ear tends to interpret it as a particularly out of
          tune 3/2
        </i>
        . The ear tends to interpret more complex ratios as mistunings of
        simpler ones. When a tone and the tone 40/27 away from it play together,
        it creates a noticeable "<i>owowowowow</i>" sound. This is known as a{" "}
        <b>wolf interval</b>.
      </p>
      <div className="center">
        <button className="mb" onPointerDown={() => basicPlay([220, 330])}>
          Pure 3/2 Fifth
        </button>
        <button className="mb" onPointerDown={() => basicPlay([220, 325.925])}>
          Wolf 40/27 Fifth

      <p>
        Having inconsistent wolf intervals throughout the modal transformations
        is why our modern musical system was created. One can avoid these
        dissonances by only playing the notes of Ptolemy's Intense Diatonic in
        its root key, but that gets boring fairly quickly. It's a pretty sound,
        but it doesn't leave us with a huge amount of variety, which we crave
        for the sonic storytelling of a well-crafted piece of music. But{" "}
        <i>
          when we modulate to different keys within a simple JI system like
          this, we end up with these dissonant intervals that many people
          consider unacceptably "bad" sounding.
