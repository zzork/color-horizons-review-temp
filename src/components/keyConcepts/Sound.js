        The phenomenon of sound is the phenomenon of vibration. Something
        vibrates, which causes the air molecules around that thing to move and
        bump into the air molecules around them. This causes those molecules to
        move and bump into the air molecules around them. With each consecutive
        bump, a small amount of energy is lost, and this chain reaction
        continues until the energy emitted from the original vibration source
        has naturally disappated.
      </p>
      <p>
        This phenomenon is known as a <b>sound wave</b>. The molecules the waves
        are passing through do not move along with the wave. The wave is just a
        pattern of motion of the molecules it is passing through.
      </p>

        Eventually, these sound waves bounce off the anatomy of the inner ear,
        which converts the vibrations it receives into electrical impulses.
        These impulses are transmitted to the brain, interpreted, and gloriously
        experienced by our consciousness as <b>sound</b>.
